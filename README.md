# QraftCode
<b>Convert any text or URL into a QR code for quick access on your phone.</b>

This project is a basic QR Code generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Users can enter any text or URL into an input box, and upon clicking the 'Generate QR Code' button, a scannable QR code is instantly generated and displayed. 
The code uses the QRServer API to create the QR code image based on the input provided. If the input field is left empty, the input box briefly highlights to prompt the user to enter a valid text or URL.
This project is simple yet functional, offering a quick and easy way to generate QR codes for sharing links or information
